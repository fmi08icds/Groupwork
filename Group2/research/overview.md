## Overview of possible topic to be covered in the research presentation
- (approaches for supervised classifiation problems in math)
- (basic tools: numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib)
- Boosting libraries: [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/python_intro.html), [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python-Intro.html) and [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/en/docs/concepts/python-quickstart)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/overview) and [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)

## Work packages
- everyone choses one of the above topics (preferably the latter four)
- other ideas are also welcome
- we are expected to each do 3 minutes of the presentation
- I (niko) will do beginning and end; everyone else can do 2-3 slides for their subtopic

## Random Notes
- keras already has [pretrained models](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications)
