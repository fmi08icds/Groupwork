# Road Map
1. Implement PCA (including standardization)
2. Load ICMR data sets and merge raw data with label data
3. Investigate data set for missings
4. Descriptive statistics (distribution of cancer types, age…)
5. Perform PCA on genetic data using own implementation 
6. Evaluate proportion of variance explained and choose number of components
7. Compare results & run time with PCA implementation
8. Compare results with tSNE library results (visually)
9. (Optional) use dimensions to classify subjects into cancer type
