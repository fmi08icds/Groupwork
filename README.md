# Group work repository

Students will Six topics will be addressed and: 
- Group 1: Classification problems
- Group 2: Regression problems
- Group 3: Clustering problems
- Group 4: Dimensionality reduction
- Group 5: Model selection
- Group 6: Machine translation 

For each topic, 3-5 students will present a brief literature review of the recent advancements and existing Python libraries and choose one or two applications together. The group will then give a detailed presentation on a more specific topic, followed by a Python implementation with and without vectorization. Finally, an analysis of their performance compared to the existing Python library.
