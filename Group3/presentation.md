# 1. Introduction
- Our data set and model selection are based on the book ["The elements of statistical Learning"](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/)
- Our group focuses on linear regression problems
- A linear regression model is denoted function as $E(Y|X)$
    - $Y$ is the continuous output space on $R$
    - $X$ is the input space where an instance is a vector $\textbf{x}$ containing multiple measurements
- Benefits:
    - The trained models are interpretable
    - Reasonable performance on problems with sparse or low signal-to-noise data
