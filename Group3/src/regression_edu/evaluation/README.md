## Evaluation
This module executes the performance tests concerning the runtime and the memory usage for our implementations and for the standard libraries.
In order to generate the files in the evaluation folder, switch to this folder before running `python -m memory_profiler performance.py`.

memory profiler will output the memory consumption of the tested methods for a one-dimensional input of 500 samples. 

A stats-file for the runtime performance can be displayed via the command `snakeviz file.stats` in the terminal. This provides a link to an html view that may be opened in the browser.
