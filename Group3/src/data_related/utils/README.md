## Installing Bokeh 

Officially supported and tested on Python 3.9 

Bokeh can be installed with either `pip` or `conda` 

To install with pip, simply use the command: 
    
    pip install bokeh

To check the validity of the installation, run 
    
    bokeh info

Here, you can also find the current version of Bokeh. 

Bokeh's dependent libraries are automatically installed if the installation has been done with `pip` or `conda`

### Using notebooks with Bokeh 
To use JupyterLab with Bokeh, we simply need to install the Bokeh extension through `pip` by running 
    pip install jupyter_bokeh

**Note:** JupyterLab version should be at least version 3.0 

Once the extension has been installed, Bokeh can be run in any JupyterLab environment.
